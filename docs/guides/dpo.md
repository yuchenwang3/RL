# Direct Preference Optimization in NeMo RL

[Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18290) is an RL-free alignment algorithm that operates on preference data. Given a prompt and a pair of chosen and rejected responses, DPO aims
to increase the probability of the chosen response and decrease the probability of the rejected response relative to a frozen reference model. The actor is initialized using the reference model. For more details, refer to the
[DPO paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18290).

## Launch a DPO Run

The script [examples/run_dpo.py](../../examples/run_dpo.py) can be used to launch a DPO experiment. This script can either be launched locally or via Slurm. For details on how to set up Ray and launch a job using Slurm, refer to the [cluster documentation](../cluster.md).

Be sure to launch the job using `uv`. The command to launch a DPO job is as follows:
```bash
uv run examples/run_dpo.py --config <PATH TO YAML CONFIG> <OVERRIDES>
```
If not specified, `config` will default to [examples/configs/dpo.yaml](../../examples/configs/dpo.yaml).

## Configuration

NeMo RL allows users to configure DPO experiments using `yaml` config files. An example DPO configuration file can be found [here](../../examples/configs/dpo.yaml).

To override a value in the config, either update the value in the `yaml` file directly, or pass the override via the command line. For example:

```bash
uv run examples/run_dpo.py \
    cluster.gpus_per_node=8 \
    dpo.sft_loss_weight=0.1 \
    dpo.preference_average_log_probs=True \
    logger.wandb.name="dpo-dev-8-gpu"
```

**Reminder**: Don't forget to set your `HF_HOME`, `WANDB_API_KEY`, and `HF_DATASETS_CACHE` (if needed). You'll need to do a `huggingface-cli login` as well for Llama models.

## Datasets

DPO datasets in NeMo RL are encapsulated using classes. Each DPO data class is expected to have the following attributes:
  1. `dataset`: A dictionary containing the formatted datasets. Each example in the dataset must conform to the format described below.
  2. `task_name`: A string identifier that uniquely identifies the dataset.

If your data is not in the correct format, simply write a preprocessing script to convert the data into this format. An example implementation can be found in [preference_datasets/tulu3.py](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/preference_datasets/tulu3.py).

**Note:** The `task_name` field is required in each formatted example.

```json
{
  "context": [], // list of dicts - The prompt message (including previous turns, if any)
  "completions": [ // list of dicts — The list of completions
    {
      "rank": 0, // int — The rank of the completion (lower rank is preferred)
      "completion": [] // list of dicts — The completion message(s)
    },
    {
      "rank": 1, // int — The rank of the completion (lower rank is preferred)
      "completion": [] // list of dicts — The completion message(s)
    }
  ],
  "task_name": "task_name" // identifier for the task
}
```

DPO training supports only two completions (where the lowest rank is preferred and the highest one is rejected), with each completion being a single response. For example:
```json
{
    "context": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's the capital of France?"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "The capital of France is Paris."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Thanks! And what's the capital of Germany?"
        }
    ],
    "completions": [
        {
            "rank": 0,
            "completion": [
                {
                    "role": "assistant",
                    "content": "The capital of Germany is Berlin."
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "rank": 1,
            "completion": [
                {
                    "role": "assistant",
                    "content": "The capital of Germany is Munich."
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "task_name": "task_name"
}
```

By default, NeMo RL has support for [HelpSteer3](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/preference_datasets/helpsteer3.py) and [Tulu3Preference](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/preference_datasets/tulu3.py) datasets. Both of these datasets are downloaded from HuggingFace and preprocessed on-the-fly, so there's no need to provide a path to any datasets on disk.

We provide a [PreferenceDataset](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/preference_datasets/preference_dataset.py) class that is compatible with jsonl-formatted preference datasets for loading datasets from local path or HuggingFace. You can modify your config as follows to use such a custom preference dataset:
```yaml
data:
  # other data settings, see `examples/configs/dpo.yaml` for more details
  ...
  # dataset settings
  train:
    # this dataset will override prompt_key and use the default values for other vars
    data_path: /path/to/local/train_dataset.jsonl  # local file or hf_org/hf_dataset_name (HuggingFace)
    subset: null  # used for HuggingFace datasets
    split: train  # used for HuggingFace datasets
  validation:
    # this dataset will use the default values for other vars except data_path
    data_path: /path/to/local/val_dataset.jsonl
  default:
    # will use below vars as default values if dataset doesn't specify it
    dataset_name: PreferenceDataset
    prompt_file: null
    system_prompt_file: null
  # multiple validation sets is supported by using val_data_paths
  # this will be removed after refactor
  val_data_paths:
    <NameOfValidationDataset1>: /path/to/local/val_dataset_1.jsonl
    <NameOfValidationDataset2>: /path/to/local/val_dataset_2.jsonl
```

Your JSONL files should contain one JSON object per line with the following structure:

```json
{
  "context": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?"}], // list of dicts - The prompt message (including previous turns, if any)
  "completions": [ // list of dicts — The list of completions
    {
      "rank": 0, // int — The rank of the completion (lower rank is preferred)
      "completion": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is 4."}] // list of dicts — The completion message(s)
    },
    {
      "rank": 1, // int — The rank of the completion (lower rank is preferred)
      "completion": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't know."}] // list of dicts — The completion message(s)
    }
  ]
}
```

We also provide a [BinaryPreferenceDataset](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/preference_datasets/binary_preference_dataset.py) class, which is a simplified version of PreferenceDataset for pairwise ranked preference with single turn completions. You can use `prompt_key`, `chosen_key` and `rejected_key` to specify which fields in your data correspond to the question, chosen answer and rejected answer respectively. Here's an example configuration:
```yaml
data:
  # other data settings, see `examples/configs/dpo.yaml` for more details
  ...
  # dataset settings
  train:
    # this dataset will override prompt_key and use the default values for other vars
    data_path: /path/to/local/train_dataset.jsonl  # local file or hf_org/hf_dataset_name (HuggingFace)
    prompt_key: context
    subset: null  # used for HuggingFace datasets
    split: train  # used for HuggingFace datasets
  validation:
    # this dataset will use the default values for other vars except data_path
    data_path: /path/to/local/val_dataset.jsonl
  default:
    # will use below vars as default values if dataset doesn't specify it
    dataset_name: BinaryPreferenceDataset
    prompt_key: prompt
    chosen_key: chosen
    rejected_key: rejected
    prompt_file: null
    system_prompt_file: null
```

Your JSONL files should contain one JSON object per line with the following structure:

```json
{
  "prompt": "What is 2+2?",     // <prompt_key>: <prompt_content>
  "chosen": "The answer is 4.", // <chosen_key>: <chosen_content>
  "rejected": "I don't know."   // <rejected_key>: <rejected_content>
}
```

### Custom datasets defined outside NeMo RL

If you want to plug in a preference dataset class that lives outside the
`nemo_rl` package (so you don't have to edit the built-in registry), set
`dataset_name` to a fully qualified dotted import path. The dispatcher
will import the module and resolve the class. The class must accept the
same kwargs as the built-in datasets (i.e. the full data config) and
implement `set_task_spec`.

```yaml
data:
  default:
    dataset_name: my_pkg.my_module.MyPreferenceDataset  # importable from PYTHONPATH
```

The class must be importable — install it as a package or add its
parent directory to `PYTHONPATH` before launching training.

Please note:
- If you are using a logger, the prefix used for each validation set will be `validation-<NameOfValidationDataset>`. The total validation time, summed across all validation sets, is reported under `timing/validation/total_validation_time`.
- If you are doing checkpointing, the `metric_name` value in your `checkpointing` config should reflect the metric and validation set to be tracked. For example, `validation-<NameOfValidationDataset1>_loss`.

## DPO-Specific Parameters

The DPO implementation in NeMo RL supports several key parameters that can be adjusted:

- `dpo.reference_policy_kl_penalty`: Controls the strength of the KL penalty term
- `dpo.preference_loss_weight`: Weight for the preference loss
- `dpo.sft_loss_weight`: Weight for the auxiliary SFT loss
- `dpo.preference_average_log_probs`: Whether to average log probabilities over tokens in the preference loss term
- `dpo.sft_average_log_probs`: Whether to average log probabilities over tokens in the SFT loss term

These parameters can be adjusted in the config file or via command-line overrides to optimize training for your specific use case.

## LoRA Configuration

DPO supports LoRA on both the DTensor and Megatron backends. To enable LoRA on the default DTensor backend:

```bash
uv run examples/run_dpo.py policy.dtensor_cfg.lora_cfg.enabled=true
```

For the full reference — backend support, the DTensor vs Megatron schema comparison, config examples, parameter details, and example recipes — see the dedicated [LoRA guide](lora.md).

## Optimizations

### Chunked Linear Cross-Entropy Fusion Loss

During standard DPO training the model materializes a full logit tensor of shape `[batch_size, seq_length, vocab_size]` for both the policy forward-backward pass and the reference model logprob computation. This can cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors for long sequences or large vocabularies. The **chunked linear cross-entropy fusion loss** avoids this by computing log probabilities directly from the hidden states: it chunks the sequence dimension, projects each chunk to logits on the fly, gathers per-token log probabilities, and discards the logits before moving to the next chunk.

**Benefits:**

- Extends the maximum trainable sequence length significantly by eliminating the large logit tensor from GPU memory.
- Applies to both the training forward-backward pass and the reference model logprob computation.
- Produces numerically equivalent loss values to the standard path.

**How to enable:**

Add the following to your Megatron config in your YAML file:

```yaml
policy:
  megatron_cfg:
    enabled: true
    use_linear_ce_fusion_loss: true
    linear_ce_fusion_chunk_size: 256  # tokens per chunk; smaller = less memory, larger = more throughput
```

**Notes:**

- Context parallelism is not supported when linear CE fusion is enabled.
- Sequence packing is not supported with DPO regardless of this setting (see [#719](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/issues/719)).
- The `linear_ce_fusion_chunk_size` parameter controls the trade-off between memory savings and compute throughput. The default value of 256 is a good starting point.

## Evaluate the Trained Model

Upon completion of the training process, you can refer to our [evaluation guide](eval.md) to assess model capabilities.
