# Checkpoint Engine Design

Checkpoint engines are runtime refit transports for non-colocated generation.
They let GRPO move policy weights directly from policy workers to generation
workers without using the driver as a model-sized staging point.

The first built-in backend is NIXL. The current implementation targets policy
workers refitting non-colocated vLLM generation workers. Colocated generation
still uses the existing IPC/HTTP refit paths, and non-colocated generation
without checkpoint engines still uses the existing NCCL collective path.

The user-facing guide is [Checkpoint-Engine Refit](../guides/checkpoint-engine-refit.md).

## Goals

Checkpoint engines are designed to:

- keep GRPO orchestration independent from the transfer backend
- stream weight batches instead of materializing a full model copy in the driver
- let backend implementations own their metadata, buffers, and peer setup
- allow additional transfer backends through a class-path plugin

Checkpoint engines do not replace durable training checkpoints. They are used
only for the runtime weight update between policy and generation workers.

## Control Flow

The refit lifecycle is coordinated by `CheckpointEngineWeightSynchronizer`:

1. Read `policy.generation.checkpoint_engine`.
2. Instantiate the backend on policy workers and vLLM internal workers.
3. Call `prepare()` and collect Ray-serializable metadata from every backend
   instance.
4. Initialize policy and rollout peers with the combined metadata list.
5. Ask policy workers to send weights through the backend.
6. Ask generation workers to receive batches and load them with the normal vLLM
   weight-loading path.
7. Call `finalize_checkpoint_engine` on both sides in a `finally` block.

Policy metadata appears first in the combined metadata list, followed by
generation metadata. Backends receive `train_world_size` and
`rollout_world_size` so they can interpret that list.

## Configuration Contract

Checkpoint-engine config lives under `policy.generation`:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    backend: vllm
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    checkpoint_engine:
      enabled: true
      backend: nixl
      update_weights_bucket_megabytes: 2048
      engine_kwargs:
        nixl:
          device: cuda
          cleanup_after_load: false
          backend_name: UCX
          backend_init_params:
            ucx_error_handling_mode: none
            engine_config: MAX_RMA_RAILS=8
            device_list: "mlx5_0,mlx5_1,mlx5_2,mlx5_4,mlx5_5,mlx5_6,mlx5_7,mlx5_8"
```

`backend` can be:

- `nixl`, which maps to
  `nemo_rl.utils.checkpoint_engines.nixl:NIXLCheckpointEngine`
- a class path in `module:ClassName` format

`engine_kwargs` must be keyed by the exact backend value. For a plugin:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    checkpoint_engine:
      enabled: true
      backend: "my_pkg.refit:MyCheckpointEngine"
      update_weights_bucket_megabytes: 1024
      engine_kwargs:
        "my_pkg.refit:MyCheckpointEngine":
          transport: custom
```

The factory passes `bucket_size` in bytes plus the selected backend kwargs to
the backend constructor.

## Backend Interface

Backends subclass `nemo_rl.utils.checkpoint_engines.base.CheckpointEngine`.

```python
from collections.abc import AsyncGenerator, Generator
from typing import Any

import torch

from nemo_rl.utils.checkpoint_engines.base import CheckpointEngine


class MyCheckpointEngine(CheckpointEngine):
    cleanup_after_load = True

    def __init__(self, bucket_size: int, transport: str) -> None:
        self.bucket_size = bucket_size
        self.transport = transport

    def prepare(self) -> Any:
        """Allocate or register buffers and return Ray-serializable metadata."""
        ...

    def init_policy_process_group(
        self,
        *,
        worker_rank: int,
        train_world_size: int,
        rollout_world_size: int,
        metadata: list[Any],
    ) -> None:
        """Connect a policy worker to its transfer peer."""
        ...

    def init_rollout_process_group(
        self,
        *,
        rollout_rank: int,
        train_world_size: int,
        rollout_world_size: int,
        metadata: list[Any],
    ) -> None:
        """Connect a rollout worker to its transfer peer."""
        ...

    def finalize(self) -> None:
        """Release per-refit state if the backend owns any."""
        ...

    async def send_weights(
        self,
        weights: Generator[tuple[str, torch.Tensor], None, None],
    ) -> None:
        """Send `(name, tensor)` weights from the policy side."""
        ...

    async def receive_weight_batches(
        self,
    ) -> AsyncGenerator[list[tuple[str, torch.Tensor]], None]:
        """Yield `(name, tensor)` batches on the generation side."""
        ...
```

The `weights` generator is consumed once. `receive_weight_batches()` should
yield tensors with original parameter names and values. vLLM loads each yielded
batch immediately.

`cleanup_after_load` is read by the vLLM worker after the receive loop. Set it
to `False` when the backend keeps stable buffers and avoiding extra
`torch.cuda.empty_cache()` calls is safe for the run.

## Worker Integration

Policy workers expose `checkpoint_engine_rpc()` from `AbstractPolicyWorker`.
The RPC creates the backend, prepares metadata, joins the backend topology,
sends weights, and finalizes the backend. Each concrete policy worker supplies
the iterator used by `send_weights_via_checkpoint_engine()`:

- Megatron streams `_iter_params_with_optional_kv_scales()`.
- DTensor/FSDP2 streams the same local DTensor conversion path used by IPC and
  NCCL refit.

Some policy iterators materialize weights through distributed collectives. A
checkpoint backend must still drain the iterator on policy ranks without a
rollout peer so those collectives are entered by every required rank.

vLLM generation workers forward checkpoint-engine calls through
`collective_rpc()` into vLLM internal workers. The internal worker extension
creates the backend, prepares rollout metadata, receives weight batches, and
loads each batch with the normal vLLM load path. The vLLM worker prints timing
for each update:

```text
[vLLM refit] Loaded ... via checkpoint engine; bytes=... total=... receive=... load=...
```

Async vLLM uses `checkpoint_engine_rpc_async()` and resolves nested
`collective_rpc()` awaitables, futures, and Ray object refs before reporting
success.

## NIXL Backend

The built-in NIXL backend is selected with `backend: nixl`. It currently uses:

- NIXL agents for memory registration and transfer
- ZMQ control messages for bucket metadata and completion notifications
- two reusable transfer buffers per worker
- staged bucket copies from policy tensors into NIXL buffers
- `split_weight_chunks()` and `merge_weight_chunk_batches()` for tensors larger
  than one bucket

The current topology is paired policy-to-rollout transfer. Policy rank `i`
sends to rollout rank `i` when `i < rollout_world_size`; extra policy workers do
not send. A rollout worker connects to the policy metadata entry at its rollout
rank, so production runs should allocate at least as many policy workers as
rollout workers for this backend.

`device` controls the staged transfer-buffer device:

- `cuda`: allocate CUDA buffers and use CUDA-capable NIXL/UCX transfer. If
  CuPy is available, CUDA buffers are allocated through CuPy before being
  wrapped as torch tensors.
- `cpu`: allocate host buffers, pinned when CUDA is available.

`backend_name` defaults to `UCX`. Values in `backend_init_params` are converted
to strings before creating the NIXL backend. Use this field for NIXL backend
parameters such as UCX peer error handling, UCX device lists, and NIXL UCX
engine config.

## NIXL Preinit

NIXL/UCX backend creation can be expensive if it first happens in the critical
path. The current code preinitializes NIXL agents in two places when the config
selects `backend: nixl`:

- policy worker construction
- vLLM internal worker construction, via the vLLM worker patch hook

The preinit path uses the configured `backend_name` and `backend_init_params`.
Logs usually show NIXL agents named `preinit-...` during worker setup.

## Fault-Tolerance Boundary

The NIXL backend detects transfer errors when NIXL reports `ERR` while starting
or polling a read. The vLLM update path returns `False` on checkpoint-engine
load failure, and the synchronizer raises if any generation worker reports a
failed update.

The current implementation does not replace failed Ray actors, rebuild vLLM
engines, or retry the same refit after a peer failure. Use normal NeMo RL
checkpointing plus the scheduler or external launcher for job-level restart.

For production runs where failed peers should surface promptly, configure UCX
peer error handling through NIXL backend parameters:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    checkpoint_engine:
      engine_kwargs:
        nixl:
          backend_init_params:
            ucx_error_handling_mode: peer
```

`ucx_error_handling_mode: none` can reduce overhead for stable benchmark runs,
but it gives UCX less help reporting lost peers.

## Adding Another Backend

To add a backend:

1. Implement a `CheckpointEngine` subclass.
2. Accept `bucket_size` in bytes in the constructor.
3. Return only Ray-serializable metadata from `prepare()`.
4. Implement policy and rollout peer setup using the combined metadata list.
5. Stream policy weights from the input generator without replaying it.
6. Yield vLLM-loadable `(name, tensor)` batches from `receive_weight_batches()`.
7. Add backend-specific config under `engine_kwargs.<backend>`.
8. Use a `module:ClassName` backend string in config, or add a short-name
   mapping in `create_checkpoint_engine()` if the backend should be built in.
9. Run a non-colocated GRPO job and verify the `[vLLM refit]` timing line.

Current limitations:

- Checkpoint-engine refit targets non-colocated policy-to-vLLM refit.
- SGLang checkpoint-engine refit is not implemented.
- The built-in NIXL backend uses paired policy-to-rollout transfer only.
