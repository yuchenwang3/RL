"""Wrapper around Megatron-Bridge's quantization/export.py for QARL checkpoints.

QARL checkpoints written by ``MegatronQuantPolicyWorker`` store the layer-spec
callback as ``nemo_rl.modelopt.models.policy.workers.utils.get_quantization_layer_spec``.
Megatron-Bridge's instantiator rejects ``_target_`` strings outside its built-in
allowlist (``megatron.``, ``nemo.``, ``torch.``, ``transformers.``, ``numpy.``,
``nvidia.``), so the upstream export script fails on these checkpoints. The
training worker registers ``nemo_rl.`` at ``__init__`` time, but the allowlist
is process-local — the upstream export script runs in a fresh ``torchrun``
process and never instantiates the worker.

This wrapper registers ``nemo_rl.`` as an allowed prefix and then delegates to
``Megatron-Bridge/examples/quantization/export.py`` unchanged. All CLI arguments
pass through.
