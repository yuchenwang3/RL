"""Tests for the SGLangGeneration init chain — multi-worker orchestration,
router integration, and the Lock actor.

Instead of instantiating the full SGLangGeneration class (which needs
RayVirtualCluster), we test each component that __init__ wires together:
  • multiple SGLangGenerationWorker actors started in parallel
  • all workers registered with the real router
