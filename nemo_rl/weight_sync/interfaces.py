"""Weight synchronization interface for NeMo-RL.

WeightSynchronizer is a dedicated abstraction that decouples weight transfer
logic from both PolicyInterface and GenerationInterface. It owns the
transfer of model weights between training and generation components.

Transport-specific implementations (IPC/ZMQ, HTTP, NCCL collectives) each
encapsulate the transfer lifecycle, so algorithm code never branches on
backend type.

Colocated transports (IPC, HTTP) own GPU phase transitions internally
(offload, prepare_for_generation, restore) as part of their sync_weights()
implementation. The NCCL collective transport is a pure data mover; the
orchestrator handles phase transitions externally since policy and
generation run on separate GPU clusters.

This interface assumes **global weight updates**: all generation workers
are updated atomically and are always at the same weight version. Per-worker
updates (where different replicas could be at different versions) are not
supported. In async GRPO, heterogeneous weight ages are handled at the
sample level (via replay buffer ``target_weight_versions`` tracking), not
at the synchronizer level.
